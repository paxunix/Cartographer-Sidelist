From my days playing World of Warcraft.  It was sometimes more fun to write
addons than advance in the game.

I very much doubt this works anymore in its current state, but I've not
played WoW for several years so I'm in no position to update it.

Bring up a side panel of points on the current map.

Without the list, your map was just a jumble of icons and you could only see
what was what by clicking on each.
